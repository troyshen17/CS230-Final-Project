CS230-Final-Project: Troy Shen (troyshen) and Gunguk Kim (gunguk)

Our starter code comes from a Tensorflow implementation of Zhu et. al's CycleGan paper. The implementation was written by Harry Yang and Nathan Silberman. 

We modified the code to take in our landscape datasets instead of the Horse2Zebra dataset provided. 

To Do:
- Attempt to implement Flow Normalization
- Tune hyperparameters
